# 1. Repo-session
* Create a new directory called **0x01-git** in your **alx-pre_course** repo
* Make sure you include a non empty **README.md** in your directory:
	- at the root of your repository **alx-pre_course**
	- AND in the directory **0x01-git**
* And important part: **Make sure you commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the checker will always fail.**
## Repo:
	* Github repository: **alx-pre_course**
# 2. Coding fury road
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a **README.md**. It's time to code!
	* Inside **0x01-git**
	- Create these directories at the root of your project: **bash**, **c**, **js**
	- Create these empty files:
	- **c/c_is_fun.c**
	- **js/main.js**
	- **js/index.js**
	- Create a file **bash/alx** with these two lines inside: **#!/bin/bash** and **echo "ALX"**
	- Create a file **bash/school** with these two lines inside: **#!/bin/bash** and **echo "School"**
	- Add all these new files to git
	- Commit your changes (message: **"Starting to code today, so cool"**) and push to the remote server
## Repo:
	* GitHub repository: **alx-pre_course**
	* Directory: **0x01-git**
	* File **bash/alx, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js**
